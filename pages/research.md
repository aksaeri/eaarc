# Research projects

## What are people's experiences and behaviours in response to the novel coronavirus (COVID-19)?

We are collaborating with Spencer Greenberg to explore people's experiences of coronavirus. We aim to better understand 

1. social experiences of coronavirus
2. the best related interventions and 
3. how they vary by location and demographic

For instance, we think it would be useful to track things like: 

1. what different people go through during the course of the epidemic
2. their attitudes towards, and trust in institutions
3. their protective behaviours
4. predictions about the future, and
5. responses to interventions to get them to sign and share a relevant pledge.  

We plan to do a 'living survey': one that is constantly running/updated and potentially taken multiple times by the same people over an extended period. 

We plan to host a regularly updated online graphical summary while we collect the data, probably something like [this public Tableau dashboard](https://public.tableau.com/en-us/gallery/meningitis-progress-tracker?tab=featured&topic=capability-maps
). We also plan to reach out to relevant stakeholders so that they can monitor this information.

We think that this current information will be very useful for understanding the effects of the virus on (different and the same) people over time and the extent to which their attitudes, behaviours and so on align with what we seek to promote. Analysis of such data will be useful for future policymaking and risk communication.
