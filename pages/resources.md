# Research resources

On this page we make some of the tools we use in research freely available in the spirit of [open and reproducible science](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-016-0021).

## Quality assessment

### Excel AMSTAR 2 checklist

The [AMSTAR 2 checklist](https://amstar.ca/Amstar-2.php) is widely used in assessing the quality and internal validity of review evidence. This is something we do a lot in our overview of reviews. However, completing the AMSTAR2 is not straightforward. Alexander Saeri built a spreadsheet to make this easier. You can easily import this into Google Docs to make collaborative editing easier.
